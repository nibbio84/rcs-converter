RCS Converter is a conversion tool for the RCS file format. It can convert a RCS file to a plain txt file and vice-versa.

The API provides two classes (RcsInputStream and RcsOutputStream) that can be used in any java-based application to implement built-in RCS conversion.

Requires Java Runtime Environment. Download it from: http://www.java.com/
